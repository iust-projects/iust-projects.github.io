## 3 Do this tasks for this question:
1. **Hit-or-Miss** operation has been explained in section 9.4 in the book (Gonzales), explain it.
2. Read this [paper](http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/mvmp/mvg/files/pdf/ahonen_soft_histograms_for_local_binary_patterns.pdf) and compare **LBP** and **Soft LBP**.

### 3. A **Hit-or-Miss** Operator

First thing we need to know is that HOM is used for basic shape detection which works on binary images where 1s indicate foreground and 0s for background.

HOM uses two structural elements, one for foreground and one for background.

Here is the matchematical definition of it:

![HOM formula](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_1_1.jpg)

Intuitively, it says that foreground and background structural elements must match simultaneously. But we also can represent same operation using only one structural element, here is the matchematical definition:

![HOM formula 2](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_1_2.jpg)

In this situation, structural element **B** consisits of both foreground and background pixels and that is why we need to do the operation simultaneously.
In simple words, in erosion we just check for foreground elements but in  this operation, we match foreground pixels of structural element with foreground pixels of image and **at the same time** wew also match background pixels of structural element with background pixels of image.

As a simple example, let's say we want to find a dot in image. We need that it means that a single foreground pixel should be surrended by many background pixels in all directions. So same structural element will be used and only would match when a single foreground pixel get surrended by background pixels.

Here is 3 examples of this operation:

![HOM examples](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_1_3.jpg)



### 3.B Compare Soft LBP and LBP
Soft LBP's major charactrestic is rebustness against noises and continuous output w.r.t. inputs which also can work well on degraded images.

So let's first talk about LBP itself and what makes it special. It is fast and invariant to gray-scale intensity changes which makes it tolerant against illumination changes which can be used for texture classification, face analysis, etc.

The possible problem of basic LBP could be the fixed thresholding regarding neighboring pixels where could make it very sensitive to noises.

Basic LBP compare pixels in a 3x3 window and mark lower ones zero and vice versa. Finally, summing up by weighting to power of 2 would be our desired output. This operation and its thresholding window can be represented using below depictions where P is number of sampling points on a circle of radius of R:

![fixed thresold](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_2_1.jpg)

![basic LBP](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_2_2.jpg)

Where the problem is the thresholding function which is as follow:

![basic LBP Thresholding](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_2_3.jpg)


So as we knew it from the begining the goal is to increase robustness via fuzzy membership function and here is the new defined functions where the parameter D controls the amount of fuzzification:

![soft LBP membership function formula](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_2_4.jpg)
![soft LBP membership function graph](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_2_6.jpg)

To build the histogram, now each pixel instead of contributing to only one bin where happens in basic LBP, now contributes to all bins regarding the membership function where sums up to 1 over all bins:

![pixel in bin of histogram in soft LBP](/assets/images/projects/dip/9/wiki/3_2_5.jpg)


By using this membership functions, soft LBP looses one of the upsides of the basic LBP which is invariance to gray-level illumination. But the upside effect is that small changes introduces small effects too. On top of that, another issue affecting Soft LBP is that this method is computationally expensive because the contribution of the each pixel need to be computed w.r.t. all 2^P bins.

These result comparsion could be great to finish explanation.

### 4.B Feature Extraction
1. Geometry
2. Texture

#### 4.B.a Geometry


```python
def extract_geometrical_features(images):
    features = np.zeros((len(images), 5))
    
    for i in range(len(images)):
        
        try:
            im, contour, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(train_images[i], 1, 2)
            contour = contour[0]
            area = cv2.contourArea(contour)
            perimeter = cv2.arcLength(contour, True)
            convex_hull = cv2.convexHull(contour)
            convex_hull_area = cv2.contourArea(convex_hull)
            rect = cv2.minAreaRect(contour)
            _,_, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contour)

            compactness = 4*np.pi*area/(perimeter**2)
            solidity = area / convex_hull_area
            eccentricity = rect[1][1] / rect[1][0]
            aspect_ratio = float(w)/float(h)
            extent = area / (w*h)
        except:
            pass
        
        features[i, 0] = compactness
        features[i, 1] = solidity
        features[i, 2] = eccentricity
        features[i, 3] = aspect_ratio
        features[i, 4] = extent
        
    return features
```


```python
extract_geometrical_features(train_images[0:1])
```




    array([[0.17906382, 0.46539792, 0.57727276, 0.74074074, 0.24907407]])




```python
geometrical_features_train = extract_geometrical_features(train_images)
geometrical_features_test = extract_geometrical_features(test_images)
```

#### 4.B.b Texture

Note as the size of images are not same, we need to find the maximum sized image and extend all other images to that size after extracting features.
`find_max_size` can do this.


```python
def find_max_size(images):
    return np.max([image.shape[0]*image.shape[1] for image in images])
max_len = np.max([find_max_size(train_images), find_max_size(test_images)])
max_len
```

resized = cv2.resize(train_images[70], (32, 32), interpolation = cv2.INTER_AREA)
winSize = (16,16)
blockSize = (16,16)
blockStride = (8,8)
cellSize = (8,8)
