2. Preparing Data
    1. Convert Data to Numpy Array
    2. Create Labels

## 0 Generating Synthetic Data
In this section we just generate 200 randomly sampled data which are **linearly** separable.


```python
import numpy as np
######################
# Create random data
#####################
Positive = np.random.normal(100,15,1000)
Negative = np.random.normal(-100,15,1000)
PN=[(x,y) for x,y in zip(Positive,Negative)]
NP=[(x,y) for x,y in zip(Negative,Positive)]
PP=[(x,y) for x,y in zip(Positive,-1*(Negative))]
NN=[(x,y) for x,y in zip(-1*(Positive),1*(Negative))]
N_class = PN + NP
P_class = PP + NN

########################
# Data Visualization
########################
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([x for x,y in N_class], [y for x,y in N_class], 'go', label='P')
plt.plot([x for x,y in P_class], [y for x,y in P_class], 'ro', label='N')

plt.title('synthetic data-set for XOR problem')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')

plt.show()
```

## 1 Network Structure
1. XOR problem is not linear so a single perceptron cannot separate data into desired classes but two perceptron can do this. Each perceptron handle a line and we know we can separate the classes using two straight lines. So we need another perceptron at the end to handle the combination of the outputs of two prior perceptrons. So we need 3 perceptron, 2 at first layer and one at the end to handle mapping to classes.
2. The number of features here are 2 so the I have considered 3 input for perceptron which weight of shape (2, 1) and (1,1) for bias too.
3. I have used backpropagation to optimize the weights of the perceptron.
4. Other parameters and the explanation of the how the model works has been expained through the following sections.

## 2 Preparing Data
In this step we take care of data using following steps:
1. Convert data to numpy array
2. Create labels
3. Shuffle data
4. Split data into train and test

### 2.A Convert Data to Numpy Array
As I am going to use numpy matrix operations, I need to convert all of our data to numpy arrays.


```python
data = []
size = 4000
data.extend(PN)
data.extend(NP)
data.extend(PP)
data.extend(NN)
x = np.zeros((size, 2))
for idx, s in enumerate(data):
    x[idx, 0] = s[0]
    x[idx, 1] = s[1]
```

### 2.B Create Labels
Perceptron algorithm is a supervised learning task, so the data needs labels and I have assigned:
1. 0 for Red
2. 1 for Green

Note any combination is possible.


```python
y = np.ones((size, 1))
y[size//2:,] = 0
```

### 2.C Shuffle Data
I have shuffled data because initial data was in order. In other words, first 2000 data had same label and latter half had same label so the network may memorize this order.


```python
perm = np.random.permutation(size)
x = x[perm]
y = y[perm]
```

## 2.D Split Into Train and Test
For validation purposes, I splitted data into train and test set to have more reliable accuracy.


```python
train_test_ratio = 0.9
x_train = x[0:int(train_test_ratio*size)]
y_train = y[0:int(train_test_ratio*size)]
x_test = x[int(train_test_ratio*size):]
y_test = y[int(train_test_ratio*size):]
```

## 3 Build Neural Network
1. Initializing weights randomly using normal distribution
    1. This Step is very important and till now between different ways of weight initialization like Quasi random etc, normal random has had better results. I have also scaled down around 0.01 as it has been used widely in practice.
    2. Initializing weights using any number is possible but it would be much more faster if we choose small values without zero weights because zero weights just stop learning!
2. Activation function
    1. This functions return the defined function's value regarding current weights and input values to the functions.
    2. I have defined two most known functions, `sigmoid` and `tanh`.
    3. Again, any sequence of activation functions is possible but it is convention to use `tanh` in hidden layers and `sigmoid` at the end of network, so I used same convetion.
3. Feed Foward
    1. Feedforward just multiplies input data and weights and pass it to activation function.
    2. Step 1 will be applied to all layers which means first, input and hidden layers' weights are engaged, then output of hidden layers and weights of hidden layers to final neuron.
    2. The result is network's prediction regarding given input
4. Backpropagation
    1. The main difference between a single perceptron and MLP is this step. Backpropagation enable us to transfer error from last layer(our prediction) to any of prior layers and that is why we can use multilayer perceptron.
    2. The intuitive explanation will be as follow:
        1. First we obtain difference between prediction and true labels
        2. Then we calculate how much hidden layer's activation contributed to this error.
        3. After that we do same definiton (actually obtained through taking derivatives) for other layers till to input weights.
5. Update
    1. In this step we update weights using gradient descent rule which is as follow: `w = w - alpha*dw` where `w: weights`, `alpha: learning_rate` and `dw: derivative of w`.
    2. This rule also applies on `bias` variable too. `bias` can be considered as a single weight with input value `1` permanently, so I omited separate explanation for it.
6. Cost
    1. I omit explanation of the cost function as it was not part of assignment and I have just implemented it to make sure my implementation is correct and gradients are working properly.
    2. I used cross-entopy loss
6. Training
    1. Feedforward step has been explained in the previous sections.
    2. Backpropagation step has been explained in the previous sections.
    3. Updating parameters step has been explained in the previous sections.
    4. Reporting cost is optional.
5. Testing
    1. Testing step is only forward pass after training weights
    2. I have not used thresholding in this step to enable us have a look at the values' intensities.
6. Score
    1. Calculating score is just dividing number of correct predictions by number of tests.
    2. As the activation function in the last layer is `sigmoid`, we need a `threshold system` to convert `(0, 1)` output of `sigmoid` to `{0, 1}` and `0.5` will do this for us.

    100.0



### Note
1. Our dataset enabled us to have 100 accuracy using only two neurons.
2. If we add about %10 noise to data, our accuracy will be approximately around %80 because we have only two lines with overlapping dat.
3. The solution is using 4 neurons in hidden layer to enable us having a almost seprable data.
4. The last note is that 2-neuron model takes much more time (epochs) to train rather than 3-neuron or 4-neuron model as I have made sure this result using Google Tensorflow's Playground.
